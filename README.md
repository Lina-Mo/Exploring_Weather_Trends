# Exploring_Weather_Trends

In this project, I have analysed three cities I had lived in ( Dublin IE, Vilnius LT) and living at this moment (San Jose, CA) with the global temperature data ​to compare the overall temperature trends.
I have used tools:

● SQL​ to extract the data from the database,
● Excel​ to open up the CSV files and to create a line chart.
